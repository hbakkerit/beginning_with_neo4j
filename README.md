# beginning_with_neo4j

Neo4j is a graph database, emphasizing on the connections between data. https://neo4j.com
In this repository I collect stuff that comes in handy when using Neo4j. 

## cypher
Cypher is the declarative graph query language used to query Neo3j databases.
I've collected some useful queries (or clauses, says neo4j) in the [cypher.md file](./cypher.md)

## running_in_docker
In order to run Neo4j in a Docker swarm, use the stack files provided in [the Docker directory](./docker/)
