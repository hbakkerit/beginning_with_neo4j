Neo4j is a graph database, emphasizing on the connections between data. https://neo4j.com
In this repository I collect stuff that comes in handy when using Neo4j. 

## Cypher
Cypher is the declarative graph query language used to query Neo3j databases.
I've collected some usefull queries (or clauses, says neo4j) in the neo4j_clauses.md file.
